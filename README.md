## State Management with Redux

The app uses **Redux Toolkit** to manage the application state. The key slices are: **Product Slice**, **Cart Slice**, **Order Slice** and **Authentication Slice**.

## Firebase Integration

This project integrates **Firebase** for both user authentication and data storage.

### Firebase Services Used:

- **Firebase Authentication**: For user sign-up, login, and managing sessions.
- **Firestore**: For storing products and orders data.

### Firebase Setup:

1. Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add Firebase configuration details to `firebaseInit.js` in the `src/` directory. Ensure you enable Firebase Authentication (for email/password sign-in) and Firestore (for storing product and order data).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux , React Router, CSS
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Authentication)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel (via Create React App)
